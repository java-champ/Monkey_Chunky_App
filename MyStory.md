Once upon a time there lived a monkey and a crocodile who were very good friends.
They lived on a tree near a river bank.
Everyday the monkey would give the crocodile sweet berries to eat.
The crocodile used to share the sweet berries with her wife.
One day the crocodile's wife got jealous and wanted to eat the monkey's heart.
She thought that if the monkey eats so many sweet berries how sweet would his heart be.
So one day she told the crocodile her desire to eat the monkey's heart.
She somehow managed to convince the crocodile.
The crocodile went to the monkey and said " Please come to my house to eat lunch with me. I will carry you on my back. "
The monkey readily agreed unaware of the real intention.
On their way the crocodile told the monkey the truth and told him about her wife's desire to the his sweet heart.
The smart monkey remained calm and instead replied, " Why didn't you tell me this before? I have left my heart on the tree! Let us go back to the tree and get my heart. Then we can continue. "
The foolish crocodile, believing the monkey's story, agreed at once.
He swam back to the berry tree.
The smart monkey jumped up the tree as fast as he could and sat there.
The crocodile asked him to bring his heart so they could continue.
The smart monkey laughed at the foolish crocodile and said, " how can I leave my heart somewhere else? You have betrayed me. From now on we will not be friends. "
And so their friendship ended.
